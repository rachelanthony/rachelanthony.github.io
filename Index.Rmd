# Data Origin  
## COVID-19 Deaths: 1/03/2020 - 17/04/2020  
 
COVID-19 hit the news headlines in December 2019, the first identified case was in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally resulting in a pandemic. The first recorded case hit UK shores on the 31st January and the UK experience its first **COVID-19** related death on 28th February in Scotland. In England the first death was on 4th March.  The following considers datasets available through the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsinvolvingcovid19bylocalareasanddeprivation) website concerning the deaths caused by COVID-19 in England from the 1st March 2020 to the 17th April 2020.  

![](COVID-19.png)

Between 1 March and 17 April 2020 there were 90,232 deaths occurring in England and Wales that were registered by 18th April. Almost 22.5% of these deaths involved the coronvirus (COVID-19).  

The information used in these datasets were collected by the Office for National Statistics when certified deaths were registered with the local registry offices. The data provided offers information regarding the number of total COVID-19 related deaths as well as the death rate per 100,000 people according to age, region, gender and deprivation scale.

The data used was provided in a very large excel spreadsheet, with multiple sheets, and I have used a number of differing datasets for this project. As a results I do not have one 'master' dataset, instead I have a few. The datasets provided by the Office for National Statistics were not very R friendly, so they needed some manipulation before uploading to R as csv files. Below is an example of a couple of the datasets I have used.  


### Weekly Deaths by Age Group and Gender
``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=20}
WD <- read.csv('Weekly Age Male Female.csv')


head(WD)
```



### COVID-19 Related Deaths compared against Deprivation Scale in Males and Females
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
Deprivation <- read.csv('Death.Deprivation.csv')
```
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
head(Deprivation)
```

### Deprivation across regions in England

This data was also acquired from the Office for National Statistics [Website](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/fe6c55f0924b4734adf1cf7104a0173e_0).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
DeprivationRegion <- read.csv('Deprivation Original.csv')

head(DeprivationRegion)
```



# Research Questions

COVID-19 is a factor in everyone's lives at the moment, most people are aware that the elderly and sick are the most vulnerable, but even in the first six weeks of the virus hitting the UK people from every age and background were affected.

The following graphics will attempt to show that even though the death rate among the most vulnerable is high, anyone could be afflicted by it. 

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

TotalDeaths <- data.frame(Deaths = c(84908, 19135),

```

#### Total Deaths in England  

Cause  | Total Deaths|  Male  |  Female
-------- |------------| ------ | -------
COVID-19 |  19,135    | 11,472 |  7,843
Overall deaths    |  84,908    | 43,306 |  41,602
Percentage of Deaths caused by COVID-19 | `r (19135/84908)*100`% | `r (11472/43306)*100`% | `r (7843/41602)*100`%

By April 17th 22.5% of deaths in England was caused by COVID-19, this was higher for Males (26.5%) compared to females (18.9%).

## Visualisation 3  
### How COVID-19 has affected different age groups  

By the 10th April 2020 no children under the age of 10 years had been killed by COVID-19, and so a figure is not included to represent this age group, as it would just be blank.

The original data set split age groups into every *5 years*, (e.g. 5-9, 10,14), totalling 20 age groups. To represent these small age ranges would produce too many figures, and be too many variables on a graph to be meaningful. It was decided instead to group these age groups together to cover *10 years* (e.g. 10-19, 20-29, 30,39) resulting in a total of 10 age groups.

```{r, echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Age.Percent <- data.frame(Deaths=c(117,267,837,1811,3917,5615,2498),

```

### How COVID-19 has affected different groups according to their level of deprivation

The Office for National Statistics use the 'English Index of Multiple Deprivation' (IMD) to assess the level of deprivation in different regions of England. The dataset provided by the Office for National Statistics uses LSOAs (lower layer super output areas), which are geographical hierarchies. In England there are over 30000 of these areas. For simplicity, these LSOA's were grouped by region and an average deprivation score was calculated.



The IMD considers a multitude of factors including:

* Income  
* Employment  
* Education  
* Health  
* Crime  
* Barriers to Housing & Services  
* Living Environment  

The scale has scores of 1-10, with 1 being the highest deprivation, and 10 being the lowest level of deprivation.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}

#This dataset has over 32000 variables, considering the deprivation of individual LSOAs would be very complicated and time consuming.

Mean.Deprivation.Region <- aggregate(IMD~Region, Deprivation.Region, mean)
#A new data set was created where the mean IMD score was calculated for each region.

# Summary  

### What I have learned:  
I've learned that with R you can be very specific about how you want your outputs to look, and maintain consistency in similar outputs by altering the same piece of code. This is something that is not very easy and quite time consuming on software such as Microsoft Excel.  



### What I would do next:

The obvious thing to do next would be to wait for the peak of COVID-19 to pass and reassess the data to see what, if any, changes there are in the trends seen so far. With more time and practive I would like to be able to manipulate data frames more thoroughly to create more interesting comparisons of different types of data.

The thing I struggled to get my head around the most was what type of graph was appropriate for the data I wanted to present (basic maths I know). If I were to do more data visualisations with more time I would sit down and learn the purpose of each type of graph in detail so that the data is presented in the most efficient way.
